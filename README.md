# Happy Birthday Akkama! 

This project (made with React) was my gift to my sister ([@sivasweatha](https://github.com/sivasweatha))'s 20th birthday.

I also created an [blog](https://ulagellam.com/blog/pausing-video-specific-second-guide) on how to do the last disabled move on button.

You can find the [demo](https://sivasweatha-bday.vercel.app/) of my present hosted at Vercel.
